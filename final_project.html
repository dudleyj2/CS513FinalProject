<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Shared electric scooters first hit consumers in September 2017 when the then start-up, Bird, descended on Santa Monica, California.  Within 14 months, the company was valued at over $2 billion and had a presence in over 100 cities around the globe.  Shortly after that initial launch, more companies like Lyft, Uber, Spin, and Lime introduced their electric scooters.  What began as a novelty quickly drew controversial opinions and government regulations, but has more or less survived and is here to stay as a legitimate form of transportation around city centers.
According to the TomTom Traffic Index Report, traffic across cities worldwide had been steadily increasing for years until the Covid-19 pandemic temporarily reduced the number of commuters and city residents in many metropolitan areas.  After initial shake-out phases and pilot programs, many American cities in particular have embraced scooter programs not only as a way of reducing traffic, but as an extension of public transportation where infrastructure where it is lacking.  There are many things to be learned about these scooters, and thankfully they produce a lot of data [fix sentence]</p>
<h2>Identified Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset that has been selected for this project is E-Scooter Trips â€“ 2020 from Data World and the city of Chicago.  This raw dataset consists of ~630,000 entries of scooter commuter data in Chicago, Illinois, from August to December of 2020. </p>
